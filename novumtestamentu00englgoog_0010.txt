4 PREFACE.

that this work will not suffer in comparison with any
other Greek book published in the country. This is pan
ticularly the case with respect to the E pistles and Apoca-
lypse. In this part of the work, the editor having learned
to distrust the accur-acy of the English copy, compared
the text with a very accurate copy of Mill’s Testament,
published at Oxford in 18253 the various readings, with
Griesbach’s Testament, published in Cambridge, New
England, in 18093 and corrected the Scriptura references
by examining every passage referred to in theOld and N ew
Testament and the Apocrypha. The result of his labour
has been the correction of several hundred errors which
are found in the London edition of the Polymicrian Testa-
ment. Yet, after all, there may be errore found, for which
indulgence must be solicited, in the words of the learned
Dalzel: “Sed quam ait dffcile, vel polias quam sit im·
possibile, in hisce rebus minutia tractandis omni vitio
caruisse, eruditissimi homines optime nomntst‘

The work is now committed to the candour of the Ame-
rican public, with the humble hope that it may prove an
acceptable offen-ing to' the theological student and the
minister of the gospel, and a valuable help to the youth
of our country, in the study of a language so highly
favum-ed in being made the vehicle of divine inspiration.

The various readings, which in Griesbach are denoted
by arbitrary characters, are in this edition expromed by
the letters of the alphabet.
