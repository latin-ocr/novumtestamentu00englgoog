Annona the numerous editions os the Greek Testament
which have been published os late years, both in Europe
and America, none, it is believed, combures the advan-
tages of variety os matter, and convenience os form, in an
equal degree with the Polymicrian Testament, edited by

Bagsoer of London. The text of this edition is that com·
monly called the Received Text, which was first pub·
lished at Leyden, A. n.1624,byE120vir, and republished
in solio at Oxsord, by Mill, A. n. 1707. The centre column
contains, (1.) The emendations and select various reed-
ings, found in Griesbach's Testament, published at Leip-
sic, in 18053 (2.) The present tenses os ali the most diffi-
cult νει-ως (3.) Tm words supplied which are necessary
ω complete the sens03 and (4.) Numerone references ω
passages in the Septuagint, Apocrypha‚ and New Testa·
ment, in vvhich the same Greek word is found.

ttuinment of this object, much nid has been derived from
the labours os a native Greek cornpositor, in the printing

office. In point os neatneoe and correctness, it. isabelieved
