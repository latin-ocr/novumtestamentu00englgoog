lv ADVRRTISEMENT.

lated and improved by the Rev. Dr. Robinson, late
Professor of Sacred Literature, in the Theological Se-
minary or Andover‚ Mass. It contains all the words
in the Greek Testament. with the exception of proper
names, as well as those in Griesbsch’s various read-
ings, with their derivations, principat inflexions, and
copious definitions, supported by references to the pss-
sages where the word is so applied.

In preparing the present edition, no paine have been
spared to render it at once creditahle to the American
prees, and acceptable to the Biblical student. Nearly
one thousand corrections have been made upon the
stereotype English edition, many of them, indeed, but
of little importence in themselves, but others calcu·
lated to perplex or mislead the student. It is now
offered to the public as a work containing a more vain.-
able apparatus for understanding the original ot tho
New Tonantem, than is to be found in any volume of

tho same size ever published.
