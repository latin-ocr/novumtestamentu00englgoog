Δ uuum. Leucon to the Greek Testament, suited
at once to the wants of the mere learner, and of the nore
advanced student, has long been a desideratum in the
literature of our country. The work, of which this is
a reprint‚ was compiled by the late william Greenfield‚
of London, and is one of a series of Biblical works,
published by Mt. Bagster, which stand as a lasting mo·-
nument of the piety‚ diligeme, and learning os their
editor. The example of Greenfield deserves to bc held
up to American youth, as affording a noble instance of
persevering literary ambition, guided by a spirit oi*
piety‚ and directed to the best ends. Though the greater
part of his life was spent in learning und practising the
business of a bookbinder‚ he contrived to acquire such
a knowledge of languages, both ancient and modern,
as entitled him to rank with such linguists as Pros.
Lee, and Dr. Adam Clarke. Of this, a most striking
proof is found in the fact, that at the time of his death,
which occurred in 1831, at the early age of thirty-two.
he held the highly responsible station of superintendent
of translations of the Bible in foreign languages‚ pub-
lished under the care ol’ the British and Foreign Bible
society.
